# Project
Jewelry Records

## Synopsis
This project consists of a GUI that keeps track of a hypothetical jewelry store's sales, customers, and jewelry inventory that was sold, using ComboBoxes, TextFields, etc. It also has a simple method of searching for a particular customer account. 

## Motivation
I wanted to create something that's both efficient and simple to use, in hopes of gaining attention for future jobs/companies. 

## How to run
Download and open the zip file and click on the .java file. Then proceed to click run.

## Code example
ComboBox<String>cbo = new ComboBox<>();
cbo.getItems().addAll("Customers","Jewelry","Payments","Profits");
cbo.setStyle("-fx-color:blue");
cbo.setValue("Customers");

This line of code is important to me because it shows the basis of what the program is all about.

## Test
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the file
3. Find the file named com.company, until you find the .java file that's the official code
4. [Main.java.zip](https://github.com/Dyl-bit/Project/files/12478335/Main.java.zip) When the code is found, simply click run and add any changes you like to the information presented on the code
